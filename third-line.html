        <h1>Third Line of Defense</h1>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <p>The third line of defense is composed of white blood cells that target specific pathogens. This is part of the active and adaptive immune systems. anything that can be identified as foreign is targeted and destroyed. Leukocytes are comprised of the following categories.</p>

                        <p>Neutrophils are a type of phagocyte that make up 40-70% percent of all white blood cells in the body. They are able to move independently using thier own energy, and therefore quickly converge upon sites of infection. Once at the infections they will either ingest the invading microorganisms through a process known as phagocytosis, release proteins to help combat the infection, or release a web-like structure of DNA called a Neutrophil extracellular trap that traps the pathogens and prevents their spread.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Lymphocytes make up 18%-42% of all white blood cells in the body. They include T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. They are the most prevalent type of white blood cell found in the lymph, hence the name lymphocyte (<i>-cyte</i> means cell).</p>
                        <p>T cells are further divided into three different subcategories, helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and memory T cells. Helper T cells assist the immune response once they have been activated by antigens. They produce cytokines and rapidly multiply to "help" the other immune cells. Cytotoxic T cells kill infected cells and cancer cells. During an organ transplant, these are the cells that are affected by immunosuppressants. The memory T cells are what remember the pathogen when it reenters the body and restart the immune response.</p>
                        <p>B cells make antibodies which fight the invading pathogens, and also clean up dead and damaged cells after T cells attack.</p>
                        <p>Natural killer cells are extremely similar to the cytotoxic T cells as they both kill virus-infected and cancerous cells. They are always prevalent in the blood, and do not require activation to do their work. If they come across a cell that is missing the markers that identify it as healthy, they destroy it. T cells cannot do that function, so natural killer cells play a vital role in the immune system.</p>

                        <p>Monocytes are the largest type of leukocytes. They assist in phagocytosis, cytokine production, and are able to differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells.</p>

                        <p>Eosinophils fight against parasites and certain infections. They, along with basophils and mast cells are what control allergic reactions. A high level of eosinophils often indicates a parasitic infections.</p>

                        <p>Basophils are the least common type of white blood cells. They are mostly responsible for inflammation and allergic reactions. They also contain heparin, an anticoagulant that prevents blood clotting, and the vasodilator histamine, which allows blood to get to tissues quicker then usual.</p>
