                    <p>Natural immunity comes from your own body and its functions. You can get natural immunity from fighting off previous infections, and from receiving antibodies from breast milk.</p>
                    <p>Artificial immunity is a section of preventive healthcare that aims to reduce the risk of illness and death by immunizing individuals before they naturally contract the disease. Tetanus serves as an excellent example, as the toxin produced by the bacterium can be lethal before the body mounts a natural immune response. To address this, the toxin is inactivated to form a toxoid, which is then introduced to the body through vaccination. This allows the body to generate an immune response against the toxin. Vaccinations function similarly by introducing weakened or dead versions of pathogens, or specific components like proteins, to enable the body to better combat actual pathogens. For instance, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine utilizes mRNA to prompt cells to produce antibodies against the virus.</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="active-passive">Active vs. Passive</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Active immunity requires effort by the body, and can be seen through vaccinations. Your body has to make the antibodies after getting vaccinated in order to repel the pathogen.</p> 
                    <p>Passive immunity requires no effort from your body. A good example of passive immunity are the maternal antibodies that pass through the placenta and through milk to the babies. The transfer requires no active effort by the body's immune system.</p>
