                <p>The second line of defense is still part of the innane immune system, but now it focuses on internal functions of the body. These are still general defense mechanisms, involving fevers, inflammation, and macrophages.</p>

                    <p>Fevers are an important part of the immunes response. Pathogens are accustommed to living in temperatures that mimic the human boady, and they reproduce extremely quickly at that level. Pyrogens are introduced into the blood stream when foreign matter enters the body. The pyrogens make their way to the hippocampus which in turn raises the internal body heat. The raised body heat slows down the reproduction of the pathogens, and in turn it gives the body more of a fighting chance.</p>
                    <p>However, fevers arent all great. If you body temperature is too high for too long it can also hurt other parts of the body, and cause helth complications such as febrille seizures, brain damage, and even death in some cases.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>The reason for inflammation is to protect the body from any further injury and to simultaneously get rid of dead and injured cells quickly. The five signs of inflammation are heat, pain, redness, swelling, and loss of function, which is consistent with the mental image of an ankle swelling extreme amounts and turning bright red. Since swelling is a nonspecific response, it doesn't directly target any bacteria or virus and therefore tends to go overboard to err on the safe side.</p>
                    <p>Inflammation causes vasodilation, allowing for white blood cells to respond to the harmful stimuli quicker than usual and leading to a quicker recovery time. This is what causes the redness as more blood is flowing, as well as the swelling and heat. The pain is caused by the inflammatory chemicals that are secreted by the damaged cells and cause pressure on the nerves.</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="macrophages">Macrophages</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Macrophages are white blood cells that are part of the innate immmune system. They devour pathogens that lack proteins normal, healthy bodies have in a process called phagocytosis. M1 macrophages release cytokines to induce inflammation, whereas M2 macrophages can also act [an] [as] an anti-inflammatory agent by releasing other cytokines. Through phagocytosis, macrophages envelop and eat antigen-[labelled] [labeled] foreign matter to keep the body safe and healthy.</p>
