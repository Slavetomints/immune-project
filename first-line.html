        <h1>First Line of Defense</h1>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <p>The first line of defense is comprised of external barriers to pathogens. It requires no previous exposure to the pathogen to function, as it is a nonspecific form of defense. It is comprised of skin, saliva, tears, mucus, stomach acid, and gut bacteria. It is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system" rel="noopener noreferer" target="_blank">innate immune system</a></p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="skin">Skin</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The skin acts as a physical barrier to the outside world, keeping pathogens and germs out while protecting the tissues underneath it. Sweat and sebum secreted by the skin contain antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin, psoriasin, dermcidin, and human hBD-2. These deal with the various harmful bacteria and flora found on the skin.</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="saliva">Saliva</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Saliva works to maintain the pH level in the mouth and contains multiple enzymes that serve as antibacterials. For example, lysozyme attacks the cell walls of bacteria, while Phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> causes histamine release in basophils.</p>

                </div>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="tears">Tears</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Basal tears lubricate and nourish the cornea of the eye. The flushing of tears clears it of dust, and the fluid is made up of many components, including lysozyme, immunoglobulins, and water. The immunoglobulins are better known as antibodies, and they are used to identify and kill bacteria and viruses. The lysozyme dissolves the peptidoglycan (outer coating) of bacteria.</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="mucus">Mucus</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Mucus is a liquid that is 95% water but is extremely important in immunity. Mucus is secreted by goblet cells in the airways, digestive tract, and female reproductive system. It prevents infection through the use of lysozymes and immunoglobulins, as well as reducing the amount of surface area that bacteria can interact with by acting as a cover for the internal walls of organs. It is particularly important in the stomach, where the thick mucus there protects the inner lining of the stomach from the highly acidic digestive acids.</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="stomach-acid">Stomach Acid</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Gastric acid, better known as stomach acid, sits at a pH of 1 to 2. This is extremely acidic and is very dangerous for microbial pathogens. As a result, it is the perfect chemical barrier to foodborne illnesses, and the bacteria die in the acidic conditions of the stomach.</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="gut-bacteria">Gut Bacteria</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Gut bacteria are the flora that comprise the digestive tract. It is a symbiotic relationship between the bacteria and the host. The bacteria receive food and shelter, and the human host gains resistance to pathogens as a result. Gut bacteria are usually present about 1-2 years after birth, and as a result, babies need to be careful about what they eat as they can easily get an infection.</p>
